# Architecture: Feature-Sliced Design

Organize by features with layers (app, pages, widgets, features, entities, shared)

## Folder Structure
```
src/
lib/
utils/
types/
```

## State Management: context
Use Context API for cross-component state.

## Side Effects: service-layer
Create service files for external calls.
